# Frontend App

This folder contains the frontend code, which was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you would
like to use a newer version of the CRA template, please run the following
commands in the root directory:

```shell
rm -rf app
npx create-react-app app
```
