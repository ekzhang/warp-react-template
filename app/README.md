# Frontend App

This folder contains the frontend code, which was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If you would
like to start fresh with the latest version of the CRA template, please run the
following commands in the root directory:

```shell
rm -rf app
npx create-react-app app
```

However, the current frontend template also includes a GraphQL client setup
using Urql, with caching and subscriptions set up properly. It also sets up a
backend proxy for development, as well as Prettier for source code formatting.
